## Keeping Ham Radio Alive and Well: ARRL’s Education Initiatives 

Becky Schoenfeld, W1BXY, Manager of ARRL’s Publications and Editorial Department, discusses how changes in the ham radio hobby and service led ARRL, the national association for Amateur Radio in the US, to survey recent licensees regarding their motivations, interests, and needs. Survey responses indicated a need for education in language that new amateurs could understand, on topics that they weren’t finding anywhere. In response to that need, ARRL has launched two education initiatives – On the Air magazine and the ARRL Learning Network – that will be discussed in this session.
